# My-Beginner-Python-Learning-Projects
# 100 Days of Code with Dr Angela Yu I got off Udemy to improve my Python skills.
# I like her approach to teaching as it is very handson and points you in the right direction, not holding your hand for each step. It also helped me to think more about how I approached my logic when coding and the benefits of using sites like www.draw.io.
# Some projects took longer than expected but it does feel rewarding when you're done and your code is excuted correctly without errors.
