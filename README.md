# My-Beginner-Python-Projects
# This is my first week going through Python with Dr Angela Yu, 100 Days of Code Challenge.
# I like her way teaching as it is very handson if you're sticking to the module honestly. It forced me to think more about how I approached my logic when coding and the benefits of sites like www.draw.io.
# Some projects took longer than expected as I am starting from scratch but it does feel rewarding when you're done.
